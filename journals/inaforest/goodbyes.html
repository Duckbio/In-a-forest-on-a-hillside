                <p>
Thank you so much for taking the time to read, even if you just read a sentence and jumped to this; I appreciate it!! :D
I wanted to rant about the process, methodology, thought process, emotions etc. involved in writing this anthology.

                    It's been quite a journey, which I never dreamt I'd think of publishing. I just picked poetry up as a random thing I decided to try out one night, and it led to this.
                    The first 'poem' I wrote was on the 20th of November, 2023. So, almost a year ago. I found it to be an easier, and more aesthetic way for me to write down about how I feel, as I always was so lazy writing in my journal.
                    While the poems do span a year, there is a SIGNIFICANT pause between 'The hospital' and 'bleed like I do'.

                <p>
                    This happened because I have a strange mindset, where if I create something I am proud of, I tend to avoid that art entirely, out of fear that the next piece could never live up to the perfect one. I considered 'The hospital' to be an outstanding poem and it resulted in that mentality, though to be honest nowadays I don't quite enjoy it so much. I feel as if it's missing something, though, to be fair, I have that feeling about all my poems.

                    But, I've learnt to just accept I will spew out garbage and only strike gold every now and again. I hope through most of these mediocre, lacklustre poems you find some specks of gold. It's good to keep in mind that even Einstein was wrong about a ton of his theories; or that even your favourite artist has some really shit songs :)

                    I hate yapping so much, I get the feeling that nobody actually cares, so if anyone does care and wants some background info, or hidden insights for a certain poem please contact me!!!!!!!!! Honestly, please just message me even if u have nothing to say, just tell me you read the poems, it'd mean so much to me :`). I have attached some ways to do so below :D
