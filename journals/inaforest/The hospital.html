                <pre>
The band-aid on my heart
that stopped the flow
of painful thoughts throughout,
has been tastelessly ripped off. 

I hate the nurse,
whom feeds me poison,
has me cursed;
but I can’t help but stay and hurt.

I hate the patient next to me,
who’s lavished in gold,
they’re new to the ward,
but already already treated as a god.

But, maybe the poison isn’t so bad,
as long as the other inmates get gold and silver,
I’d be happy to die here and wither.

I was once the doctor,
we were partners in crime,
but she thought it’d be better if I were to die,
so here I am, poisoned and cursed,
a fun little experiment for the nurse.
