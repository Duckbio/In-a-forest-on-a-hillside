                <h1>a review of my suicide note</h1>
                <pre>
I read my stupid fucking suicide note
and it was the most cringeworthy, self-centred shit I have ever read
it is written proof of how pathetic I am
it is written proof of how self-absorbed I am
it is written proof of how hopeless I am
I feel so incredibly spiteful towards my old self
for having written such an -

actually idk
I think it was a product of its time
I felt alone and desperate and all I was stuck with was my own thoughts
much as I am now
it’s only normal I became so self-absorbed, if you can even call it that
nothing about the note is self-absorbed, really
it was a very brave note, it outlined thoughts I never would and never will have the courage
to show to the outside world so publicly 
I stated peoples names and stated how they affected me
without putting any blame on them, instead putting it on myself
for getting bogged down in them rather than growing from them

it was really interesting to discover how things have changed
how I’ve grown and where I haven’t
it seems I’m just as immature as ever, 
but now I have the self-awareness to at least pretend
I’m doing something about it
I guess
okay bye
