There's this exhibition in the Glasgow Art Gallery by the Glasgow Boys and it has this painting that I adore. It's a painting of a girl walking through a field in springtime, when all the cherry trees had bloomed. Next to her is a calf trying to nibble at her dress, her mom following behind the girl, probably still holding a fearful curiosity. Every time I go to Glasgow, I make it my mission to stop by that gallery to see the painting, I just sit and stare at the painting and it makes me feel so incredibly serene, the simple beauty it exudes makes me feel like I'm a child again, walking through a warm field of grass with my dog running next to me. I stare at it for ages, and I'd honestly wish to stare at it 'till I die.

        <p>That's how I feel about you. That's how I feel about your beauty. That's how I feel about your blue eyes, that made my brain melt whenever I stared into them. That's how I feel about your face, that made me fall for you the moment I met you. That's how I feel about your essence, your soul. That's how I feel about you.</p>
