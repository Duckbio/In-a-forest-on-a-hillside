I just
had a dream
and it made me realise.
I'm not sure
how to explain, but
I had a dream that my ex read 'warmth',
and she started dissing me about it or something
that I'm not over her
and I said:
'oh please these were written 8 months ago'
'when I had this image in my head of you being this deity'
'this deity that was so perfect it could only be my fault.'
it just made me realise
that thats what my next poems have to be about
all my old poems have portrayed the other person as perfect
warmth described my ex as this
amazing wonderful girl who I failed to grasp 
and it was somehow all my fault
there was no mention of her imperfections.

'a forest on a hillside' and 'a cold river'
mention no faults in my past lovers
i have yet to explore the nuance of it
i only explore my failures, not that of others
that misses out on half the beauty of it
i literally woke up because of this
idk if this is some crazy revelation 
or my brain being dumb
but I think I know what comes next!
