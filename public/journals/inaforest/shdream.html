                <pre>
End me.
End me.

I puked in the bathroom
I couldn't take the pain
I scalded my hand with burning water
I didn't take it away
I let it boil
I puked in the sink
And fell on the floor
I don't know what to think
For, I know I will never be happy
and I know that for sure

Help me find solace
Not in another,
But in myself,
<span style="padding: 0.05rem 0; background-color: #C22441;">my one fatal flaw.</span>
                </pre>
                <p>The best art comes around when you have no intention of it being seen by anyone; this is my favourite piece and it is because of that. I had had an awful night and it culminated in me having a mental breakdown in a public bathroom in a theatre, I scalded my hand with the water running down the sink to surpress my thoughts, but it wasn't enough and my emotions got so strong I puked and I then fell against the wall and slid down slowly, hyperventilating. I then wrote that, as a desperate plee for something, someone, anything to save me.</p>
