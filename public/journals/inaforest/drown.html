                <pre>
I feel awfully alone
no solace from another
In a pond I throw a stone
and in it I uncover
a water so deep

My heart enveloped in tar
sees nothing but the familiar,
in the deep water reflecting stars.
In them I see her eyes -
stunningly blue, my very demise.

So, help me, god.
Help me find my way out
as the stone has dragged me
by its shackles
into the deepest depths,
of the cold, cold dark;
and as my lungs fill with water
and my minds empties throughout,
I realise.

                <p>I love this one, 10/10, incredible, please pin it on your wall and cherish it. I'd love to explain each verse with its individual and collective beauty and fangirl myself like no one else has ever fangirled, but I'm too lazy lol. One line stands out though: "I drown, to never breathe again"; it is a metaphor by which I realised that my only way of drowning out my thoughts and feelings is through suicide. Don't worry though, I won't kms lol</p>
