I want to be a better person 
but I just dont know how to grow 
past who I am

All I get is thrown away 
from people's lives 
but I just dont see
I can't see
whats wrong with me 
past my neediness,
my emotional greed.

I always see myself as 
evil 
but past that 
I dont actually know 
what the evil is 
and how to move past it.
