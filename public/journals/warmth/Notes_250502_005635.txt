the unloved,
formerly unchristened
by decree of the above,
fell through hell itself.

the flames by which
love was to be found
envolped him in screams
of cold, cold anguish

each layer passing 
the unnurtured was punished;
for his sinful nature
may he atone his sins.

the prods and lashes
he faced
were unbearable,
yet felt de-se-rved

they taught him,
though he felt un-ner-ved,
that though in hell
the world may burn
and his pain
may swell and spurn

there was still hope.
for though his sins
may make him pay
forgiveness was 
but a step away,

for the beauty
of salvation
is that it 
is also one's damnation
it just depends
on how you act,
how you see,
and the mere fact

all one has to do
to rise from flames
and bathe in 
rivers of forgiveness,
waters that cleanse sin,
is to forgive themselves.

To find peace
within oneself,
is as painful
as the whips of sin,
but at the end,
only some will bathe
in the soft waters
of the within.
