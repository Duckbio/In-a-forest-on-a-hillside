I just feel so alone, so incredibly alone
Why do I feel like this?
I have friends
I have my brother 
My friends
But I just cant stop feeling alone
I just keep on thinking about her
I dont even want her man
I feel so uncomfortable around the idea of her ever dating me again
so its not her I want
I just want to be held and cherised
And she's just the only person who felt that way towards me
But in the same time I know that when I had it
I just felt as bad as I do now
So im just stuck with this

probably not :)
