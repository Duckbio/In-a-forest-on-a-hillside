is a scary thing,
isn't it?

To throw in your towel,
to call it a day,
let it just stay.

I just can't do that.
I can't.
How could I accept myself?
How could I accept the past?
How?

I can't get over you,
I can't accept you're gone.

I can't accept myself,
not after everything
and everyone
i've wronged.

I just can't do that.
I can't.

Please, come back.
