I miss the snow,
I miss the sun,
I miss all and everyone 

I miss you,
I miss your face,
and how your every move
was full of grace

I miss the nights
in which our souls collided
the sparks filled the room
with light so brightly shining

It's all these things
that I miss so much,
yet I can't seem to find
any peace of mind.
How come the past
I can reminsice,
but the present
is my nemesis?

I need to learn to enjoy,
find the sun's speckled rays
in the day to day
run through fields
with freckles of wheat
and blue-green eyes
from the dew 
just after sunrise

becaue in these moments
I see you
your very beauty
morphs the landscape
into one more divine
than that of any
deity you outshine

I miss the snow,
for it is as cold
as your soft glow.

I miss the sun, 
for it is as bright
as the sparks
we saw at night

I miss all,
for even with
everyone
you are all 
that I miss.
