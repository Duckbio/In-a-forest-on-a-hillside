open casket for the world to see
your hollow chest rotting
encased by your thick ribs

one of your eyes bulges out
one last plee for mercy?
or maybe just
a pathetic peace

the dirt around you
rots
you poisoned it
with your shitty smell

the grass recedes 
and the flowers wilt
your skin hardens and 
goes black

all that's left is 
the tall tree shielding
you
and the sun's warm, warm rays
