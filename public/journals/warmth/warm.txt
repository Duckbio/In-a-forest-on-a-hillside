The muddy forest 
has now dried.

The icy river
bathes in the sunlight.

The stormy sea
has now subsided.

And hell's storms
have attrited.

I now bathe in a river;
not yours,
nor anothers.

Its waters are warm,
it covers my body
in its soft, slow current.

A lamb lies on the pasture
next to it,
it drinks from the waters
and stares at me.

A bird circles overhead
in search of fish
yet sees nothing
but my bodies meat.

I let the river
cradle and carry
me
to pastures new
where I'll go sing
a different tune.
