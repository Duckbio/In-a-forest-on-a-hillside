water, water, cleanse me of my sins,
for the bitter taste they leave in me
make me want to dissapear
and the sorry state the leave me in
I hate without a doubt
for they make it all to clear
that I'll always be at fault
and oh god, oh god
I just can't see the end
'cause I know the way I left things
I'll never ever mend

stars, oh, stars, rid me of my doubts
for every time I watch you
my brain can't figure out
why my scars open up 
and leave me full of pain
yet each time I heal
they leave without a trace
but the more I think
the more I miss
her beauty and her grace.

lord, oh lord, absolve me of my pains
as each time I dream
I dissapear without a trace
and each time I'm brought back
I feel I'll go insane
as each breath's a hollow waste
and each ache leaves me with distaste
and the pain exudes always
always.

always.
