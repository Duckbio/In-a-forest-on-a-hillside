                <pre>
I spoke with you last night
In my sorry little dream;
The fireworks sparkled and dimmed
through the sky grey and grim

We had climbed onto the rooftop,
just as we had always dreamed,
though this time I could almost feel
your hand as it touched my cold skin

We spoke as we used to,
our souls for eachother a drug,
we spoke of our lives
and I once again was struck by your love

And as we laid there,
and watched the sky as it cried,
I admit what I had pent up
all these months that had passed:

"I'm so sorry, for all that I've done
you meant everything to me 
and I fucked it up.
I never stopped to think
of how you might have felt
my love for you was deafening
and through it I was blinded
by your beauty unparalleled

I know you weren't great, 
your words certainly felt like a blade,
but god I wish we could together
happiness have found."

I looked in your eyes
and in them I saw 
the fireworks blasting with hope;
I couldn't resist,
I went for a kiss
and as our lips together sealed
I knew that our love
couldn't be killed.
