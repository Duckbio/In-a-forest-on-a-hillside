There's this exhibition in the Glasgow Art Gallery by the Glasgow Boys
        </p>
        <p>
and it has this painting that I adore.
        </p>  
        <p>
It's a painting of a girl walking through a field in springtime,
        </p>
        <p>
when all the cherry trees had bloomed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
Next to her is a calf trying to nibble at her dress,
        </p>
        <p>
her mom following behind the girl, 
        </p>
        <p>
probably still holding a fearful curiosity. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
Every time I go to Glasgow, 
        </p>
        <p>
I make it my mission
        </p>
        <p>
to stop by that gallery to see the painting. 
        </p>
        <p>
I just sit and stare at the painting 
        </p>
        <p>
and it makes me feel so incredibly serene,
        </p>
        <p>
the simple beauty it exudes makes me feel
        </p>
        <p>
like I'm a child again.
        </p>
        <p>
walking through a warm field of grass
        </p>
        <p>
with my dog running next to me. 
        </p>
        <p>
I stare at it for ages, and I'd honestly wish to stare at it 'till I die.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
That's how I feel about you.
        </p>
        <p>
That's how I feel about your beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
That's how I feel about your blue eyes,
        </p>
        <p>
that made my brain melt whenever I stared into them.
        </p>
        <p>
That's how I feel about your face,
        </p>
        <p>
that made me fall for you the moment I met you.
        </p>
        <p>
That's how I feel about your essence,
        </p>
        <p>
your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
That's how I feel about you.
        </p>
