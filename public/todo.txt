<p>Also about my ex-girlfriend. I wrote it a couple weeks after things ended between us; the night before she had messaged me telling me she found someone else and that genuienly killed me. The moment she told me that, something stupid inside of me snapped and I confronted her about our relationship and everything that happened. I'll spare the details of what did happen and what we said, but we spent the whole night talking about it, and at like 3am we just started playing minecraft together cuz I think neither of us could let go of the fact that it'd be our last time spending meaningful time together.</p>
                <p>Honestly, even now I look back at these moments and cherish them, even though they were so fucking dark. My emotions forget of the manipulation, the dishonesty, her suicide attempt, my suicide attempt. It just remembers the few and far-between moments where we genuienly loved and cherised each other. I don't know if that's a good thing or not; I guess it's better than having the awful taste of blood haunt you.</p>

<p>The first paragraph is very random, I know. I wrote it as a little jab at my ex-girlfriend, as the 'poem' was about her and a little while before I had written it she had given me a book she'd written, in which she started the story by writing a little disclaimer about how the characters were fictional and represented nobody, when in reality the main character was an extension of herself, which I'm sure she didn't even realise.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the poem, it was very messy and long. Truth is, I didn't really mean for it to be a poem, it was just a snippet of my journal until I split it into verses. But I do think it's got that corniness that something needs to be considered a poem.</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">I'm going to admit a slight degree of plagarism here, because the analogy of blue orchids I stole from the song 'orchids' by glass beach (please listen to the first glass beach album it is a wonderful experience). I think this is the type of art which only I, and I alone, will ever be able to understand and relate to. But, I'll try my best to convey the vision.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">To start with, I want to provide the context that this about my ex-girlfriend and our relationship; it is about finding solace and peace in the situation and moving on, yet always staying by the side of the memories. I wanted to utilise the orchids as both observers and omniscient beings, that have seen everything that has happened between us. I also utilised them as they convey peace and tranquility, but also death and hope.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">The first verse sets where they bloomed, a steep hill. The most special night we had shared was on this steep hill, we had found a place to sit and we drank wine while looking at the stars and we held hands while talking about our deepest feelings. I had felt so connected to her, like I had to no one else. I remember I turned around while we were holding hands and I saw her eyes, they were so beautiful it struck a chord within me that made me fall in love with her so deeply. In a way, this night set the scene for what was to come, us chasing this feeling for the rest of the year, but never quite finding it again because of our fucking stupidity.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">The last two verses are quite obvious, but I'll explain nonetheless. 'their solace mocks their beholders' sends the message that the solace that the flowers exude mock us both, since we didn't and will never find it. Then, 'their beauty will never be met' is a double entendre, as it reiterates how solace will never be found by us and it also reminds that we will never spend a night on that hill ever again. This fact ends the poem with the line 'will parade the memory of others', as the orchids almost do us a favour of reminding the world of the night we had spent, regardless of the fact it is so far gone.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">This is the last poem I wrote in this anthology about her, and I think it is a fitting ending. Though, there is more to come in later works; albeit much more lackluster than what I have created here.</p>
